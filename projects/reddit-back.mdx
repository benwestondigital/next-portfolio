This news project is a REST API that clones the back-end functionality of Reddit using Node.js and Express to serve articles, users, topics and comments in JSON format using a PostgreSQL database.

## Technology

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Jest
- Supertest

These tools are all extremely popular with developers and employers, all ranking extremely highly in the Stack Overflow developer surveys as highly used.

## Key Features

Thoroughly tested with Jest and Supertest, CI/CD, seeding

- CI / CD

Set up using Github Actions. A workflow (pipeline) is set up to run tests each time the main branch is pushed. Once the integration tests have passed, the app is deployed.

- Model View Controller Pattern

Following the MVC pattern to abstract the server into identifiable sections helps to debug errors and keep maintainable code.

- Use .env files to hide confidential information

## Problems I faced

I was having trouble with one of my tests failing. The test logic looked good and the behaviour was inconsistent, sometimes it would pass and other times it would fail.

I had two testing files set up – an app file for the endpoints, and a utils file for utility functions e.g. ones that would transform data before seeding. I eventually figured out that in one of my utility functions I needed a connection to the database, but I hadn’t set it up in that file. This led to inconsistent behaviour, where if I ran both test files at the same time it would work (due to the connection in the app file) and separately the utils file would fail.

## What I learnt

- Creating a relational database, setting up tables and inserting data

- How to seed database

- How to use Heroku hosting

- Using Express to set up a RESTful API

to be careful with how I separate test functions into files, and checking which data they might need to access to run.

## What I would improve

add more functionality e.g. voting on comments, post article, delete article
