WhereTo is a travel app that suggests locations with weather similar to your input destination. This was the final project for the Northcoders bootcamp, and was built as a team using agile methodology. It uses a non-relational database to store climate and city data, and external APIs to fetch coordinates, photos and weather data.

A few years ago I saw a fantastic map on Reddit that showed locations that had similar climates. At the time I was working selling wine, and found it so interesting that places like the Hunter Valley in Sydney, Australia had the same climate as Buenos Aires, Argentina. For bootcamp project pitches I immediately thought of this and knew this was a great idea that we could create.

## Technology

- Svelte
- Svelte Kit
- MongoDB
- TypeScript

I wanted to use technology that was highly rated by developers, so we built it with Svelte, SvelteKit, MongoDB, and written with TypeScript.
It was a steep learning curve to take on all this new technology and learn it in a short timeframe, but while undertaking the project we came to love tech, and really enjoyed building using Svelte.

## Key Features

- Utilizes non-relational database and external APIs
- Type checked with TypeScript
- Uses MongoDB Geospatial Queries to handle coordinate information

When the user enters their location, the string is passed into Google Autocomplete API, which returns a place ID. This place ID is used to query the Google Places API to get co-ordinates for the user's input destination.

The co-ordinates are then used to query the MongoDB database to return the array of cities with a similar climate.

```typescript:searchresults/index.ts
// query the database to get similar cities
	try {
		cities = await getCitiesSimilarToLocation([lng, lat], { limit: 9 });
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error);
	}

// for each city, fetch the weather and a photo
	const combinedData = await Promise.all(
		cities.map(async (city) => {
			const cityWeather = await getWeather(city.city_ascii);
			const { photo_reference } = await getPhotoRef(city.city_ascii);
			const src = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=400&photoreference=${photo_reference}&key=${process.env['VITE_API_KEY']}`;

			return { weather: cityWeather, details: city, src } as City;
		})
	);
```
Inside the Search Results page endpoint, current weather and photos are fetched for each city. These cards are iterated and rendered onto the page.

## Problems I faced

Using a meta-framework like SvelteKit offered a lot of new possibilities compared to Create React App projects like I had previously made. I found Svelte to be great and intuitive to use, but due to the lack of documentation, and my first time using a meta-framework, I had to re-write some features as I figured out better ways to approach the problem. Originally, I had made fetch requests in the file. Then, I found out about API endpoints, and moved the fetch calls into there. Finally, I learnt about page endpoints and this was the best solution for fetching data. This was a great learning experience and helped me understand how to structure a project like this in the future.

Creating the home page, in order to take the user input and turn it into coordinates I had to use the Google Autocomplete API to get a full address, and use the place id from this to call the Google Places API, fetching the coordinates needed to query the MongoDB database and grab the cities with a similar climate. Google Maps has two APIs for different purposes â€“ one for client, and one for server side. I spent an evening getting one to work, only for me to realize I had implemented the wrong one and needed the server side API. This really helped me to learn to read the documentation and understand what I need before I start writing code.

We used TypeScript on this project because it is highly rated by so many developers. TypeScript can be overwhelming at first, causing a lot of errors (but importantly, before production!). To be able to use it properly I had to spend some extra time in completing the Codecademy TypeScript course to understand how to utilize TypeScript correctly, especially with interfaces and object typing. This was a massive help to me and I will definitely use TypeScript moving forward.

When stitching the final product together, we had some problems linking all the pages together. This was our first project as a group, so merging the branches together had a learning curve to overcome. It definitely improved my Git skills.

Unfortunately, there is no live link for this project as the OpenWeather API free tier only allows for HTTP content and Heroku enforces HTTPS. Due to this, a local version of the project runs but it can't be hosted.

## What I learnt

- The usefulness of Meta Frameworks

In future projects I will take advantage of features like page endpoints to render content server-side before page load. Svelte Kit's file-based routing makes it so easy to create routes.

- Improved skill working with APIs

I spent a lot of time working with external APIs like Google Places. This has increased my confidence using these tools in future projects.

- How to use TypeScript

I learnt how to use TypeScript, and how useful it is. This will serve me well in future projects now I have overcome the initial learning curve.

- Concise syntax of Svelte

I enjoyed using Svelte, particularly how simple it is to manage state.

```js
on:submit|preventDefault={onConfirmSubmit}
```
For example, handling a form submission can be done in such a little amount of code, whereas in React this is a more verbose process.

- Improved Git skills

Working in a team on different branches and working with pull requests massively improved my skills with Git. This will be extremely helpful in future projects and working on development teams.

## What I would improve

With more time on this project I would add more features to the app, such as flight times, distance to destination, currency exchange rates. The 'my places' and 'my searches' pages are both placeholders so I would finish their functionality.

Instead of fetching data in multiple places, I would use Svelte Stores to fetch the data once and allow access to it from different places in the app.

On the location page, another API is used to fetch historic data, this is then visualised using Chart.js
