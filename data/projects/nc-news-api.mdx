This news project is a REST API that clones the back-end functionality of Reddit using Node.js and Express to serve articles, users, topics and comments in JSON format using a PostgreSQL database. There is functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting items.

## Technology

- Node.js
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Jest
- Supertest

These tools are all extremely popular with developers and employers, all ranking extremely highly in the Stack Overflow developer surveys as highly used.

## Key Features

- Testing

The app is thoroughly tested with Jest and Supertest. There are two separate testing files - app.test.js and utils.test.js. App is connected to the database, while utils is for non-database helper functions, such as ensuring the correct formatting before seeding.

```javascript:__tests__/app.test.js
// Testing a GET request to the /api/topics endpoint with Supertest
describe('/api/topics', () => {
  describe('GET', () => {
    test('200 - responds with an array of topic objects', async () => {
      const test = await request(app).get('/api/topics').expect(200);
      const topics = test.body.topics;
// Testing the shape of the returned array
      expect(topics).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
      expect(topics).toHaveLength(3);
      topics.forEach(topic => {
        expect(topic).toMatchObject({
          slug: expect.any(String),
          description: expect.any(String),
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

- CI / CD

Set up using Github Actions. A workflow (pipeline) is set up to run tests each time the main branch is pushed. Once the integration tests have passed, the app is deployed.

- Model View Controller Pattern

Following the MVC pattern to abstract the server into identifiable sections helps to debug errors and keep maintainable code.

The Controller handles the client request and invokes the model with the information contained in the request.

The Model handles interaction with the database to create, read, update and delete data.

The View is handled with the front-end Northcoders News project.

```javascript:article-get-request
// 1. Controller handles GET request
const getArticles = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { sort_by, order } = req.query;
// 2. Model is invoked with information from request
    const articles = await selectArticles(sort_by, order);
// 4. Returned articles from database sent to front-end View
    res.status(200).send({ articles });
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }


/* 3. Model queries the database and returns matching articles
   (simplified example for brevity) */
  const selectArticles = async (sort_by, order) => {
  let queryStr = `
  SELECT articles.*, COUNT(comment_id) AS comment_count
  FROM articles
  LEFT OUTER JOIN comments
  ON articles.article_id = comments.article_id
  GROUP BY articles.article_id
  ORDER BY ${sort_by} ${order};`;

  const { rows } = await db.query(queryStr);
  const articles = rows;

  return articles;
};
```

- Error handling middleware

Errors in the project are passed between error-handling blocks with use of next function. This allows useful errors to be sent back to the user.

```javascript:app.js
/* Example of an error handling block. If matched it will send the status and
   message to the user, or will pass the error to the next block*/
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  const psqlErrorCodes = ['22P02', '23502'];
  if (psqlErrorCodes.includes(err.code)) {
    res.status(400).send({ msg: 'Bad Request' });
  } else if (['23503'].includes(err.code)) {
    res.status(404).send({ msg: 'Resource not found' });
  } else next(err);
});
```

## Problems I faced

I was having trouble with one of my tests failing. The test logic looked good and the behaviour was inconsistent, sometimes it would pass and other times it would fail.

I had two testing files set up – an app file for the endpoints, and a utils file for utility functions e.g. ones that would transform data before seeding. I eventually figured out that in one of my utility functions I needed a connection to the database, but I hadn’t set it up in that file. This led to inconsistent behaviour, where if I ran both test files at the same time it would work (due to the connection in the app file) and separately the utils file would fail.

---

## What I learnt

- Creating a relational database, setting up tables and inserting data

```javascript:seeds/seed.js
// Creation of the topics table
await db.query(`CREATE TABLE topics (
    slug VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL
  );`);

// Formatting data pre-insertion (in utils.js)
formattedTopics = topicData => {
  return topicData.map(topic => {
    return [topic.slug, topic.description];
  });
};

// Data being inserted into the table using node-postgres
  async function insertTopics() {
    const formatTopic = formattedTopics(topicData);
    const sql = format(
      `INSERT INTO topics
      (slug, description)
      VALUES %L
      RETURNING *;`,
      formatTopic
    );
    await db.query(sql);
  }
```

- How to seed database

- How to use Heroku hosting

- Using Express to set up a RESTful API

to be careful with how I separate test functions into files, and checking which data they might need to access to run.

## What I would improve

add more functionality e.g. voting on comments, post article, delete article
