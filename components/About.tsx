            I first became interested in coding through playing online games
            when I was a teenager. I saw people creating programs to automate
            their character&apos;s progress and the possibilities of doing this
            blew me away. I tried my hand at learning and thought I was a wizard
            changing the colour of pages with CSS, but I didn&apos;t get any
            further than that.

            While having a fantastic time on a working holiday in Australia, I
            became interested in the future of work and how A.I. & Machine
            Learning would impact our world. I decided to change my career to be
            a part of this revolution. I got involved in Digital Marketing, and
            worked my way into being a Senior Paid Media Executive. I learnt so
            much during this period and it developed many of my soft skills like
            stakeholder management, and how to make analytical, data-driven
            decisions.

            During 2021 I fully committed to becoming a Software Developer.

            Software Development bootcamp. I finished in March 2022, and for the
            past year I have been working as a Software Engineer on Basket,
            Checkout & Payment microservices for a large e-commerce website
            exceeding Â£10m in monthly revenue.

            I have been using React, Next.js, Node, Express, and Playwright on a
            daily basis and I&apos;ve really enjoyed working with such
            intelligent people. The technical skills I have learnt, and the soft
            skills I&apos;ve gained from my Digital Marketing experience have
            helped me quickly become an important member of the team.
